@inbook{mattern-code-clay-data-dirt,
	Abstract = {For years, pundits have trumpeted the earthshattering changes that big data and smart networks will soon bring to our cities. But what if cities have long been built for intelligence, maybe for millennia? In Code and Clay, Data and Dirt Shannon Mattern advances the provocative argument that our urban spaces have been smartand mediated for thousands of years. Offering powerful new ways of thinking about our cities, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt goes far beyond the standard historical concepts of origins, development, revolutions, and the accomplishments of an elite few. Mattern shows that in their architecture, laws, street layouts, and civic knowledge-and through technologies including the telephone, telegraph, radio, printing, writing, and even the human voice-cities have long negotiated a rich exchange between analog and digital, code and clay, data and dirt, ether and ore. Matterns vivid prose takes readers through a historically and geographically broad range of stories, scenes, and locations, synthesizing a new narrative for our urban spaces. Taking media archaeology to the citys streets, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt reveals new ways to write our urban, media, and cultural histories.},

@book{uaw-mf,
	Abstract = {Amidst the widespread political and social turmoil of the 1960s a number of radical groups emerged seeking not just to reform or restructure society, but to completely transform it. Amongst those agitating for a {\^a}revolution of everyday life{\^a} were the French Situationists, Dutch Provos, San Francisco{\^a}s Diggers and a small New York based group called Black Mask who would go on to become The Family (aka Up Against The Wall Motherfucker, The Motherfuckers and UAW/MF).

Having started out with a series of impromptu exhibitions in public places Black Mask announced its arrival with an action that shut down the Museum Of Modern Art (MOMA) in 1966. Always aiming to push themselves, and those around them, further toward the concept of {\^a}Total Revolution{\^a} the group, through their actions and magazine Black Mask, moved their practice and critique beyond the art world in 1967 to challenge the growing counterculture and student movements.

Evolving into The Family in 1968 former members of Black Mask became intimately involved in the radical politics, crash pads and street life of the Lower East Side. As {\^a}flower children with thorns{\^a} they possessed a fiery rhetoric that took the slogan of {\^a}We are the people our parents warned us against{\^a} to its logical conclusion. Citing themselves as a {\^a}street gang with analysis{\^a} UAW/MF anticipated the militant swagger of the late 60s New Left whilst at the same time rejecting their peers unconditional support for authoritarians at home and abroad.

This booklet was originally co-published by Homebrew Press and Active Distribution in 2007. It brings together much of the existing material created by UAW/MF as well as some pieces that help put their work and deeds in context. In the opening article historian John McMillan outlines the history of The Family and how he came to meet leading member Ben Morea whilst in an extensive interview Morea himself discusses the actions that the group took part in as well as their key ideas. Lastly and most importantly there are reprints of UAW/MF{\^a}s original writings and collages. Mixing cartoonish humour with mystical psychedelia and intense rhetoric the works reprinted here are some of the most powerful of their time. Although best experienced with their original layout and graphics intact where the quality of the originals is too poor to be fully legible they have been included as texts.},
