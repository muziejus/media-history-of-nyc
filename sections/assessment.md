#### Plenary sessions

English 101 features four plenary sessions led by four faculty members in the
English department. With these sessions, the faculty will give you the
opportunity to be exposed both to the diverse set of interests that occupy our
department as well as the diverse faculty itself. Each faculty member will be
presenting on work that we will have read in class. The plenaries are scheduled
for Thursdays and Fridays, as noted below. 

#### Participation

**10%** The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside.  

You can miss up to two meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the third absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even *pass* the course.

Plenaries *cannot be missed*.

In a discussion-oriented class, “active participation” involves the following
components. All of these are necessary to receive maximum points for
participation:

* being in class on time,
* arriving having done the reading for that day,
* participating in short writing assignments in class,
* participating in class discussion in ways that build upon contributions from others, and
* refraining from the use of electronic devices.

#### Reading journal

**15%** For each class meeting, you will be required to email me the latest
entry in your reading journal a half hour ahead of time (at the latest). A
reading journal provides you with the opportunity to jot down both your
thoughts regarding that meeting’s reading and points of entry to the text that
will help kickstart class participation with questions about specific
passages. The journals can be written as emails and should be
around 400–600 words in length. These are experimental moments for you, so do
not hesitate to take risks in your interpretations. That said, they should be
written clearly. Additionally, this is a moment to use Baldick’s dictionary of
literary terms to expand your critical vocabulary by using the headwords I
provide for each class. Read the entries and see how they relate to the
meeting’s readings.

#### First essay

**15%** The first essay will be in response to a prompt. It should be 900–1200 words
long. It will be emailed to me by 23:59 on Tuesday, 21 Oct. You will all read
each other’s papers, and we will spend part of class on the 23rd critiquing
each other’s work. Revisions will be due at 23:59 the following Tuesday. The
grade will depend on the coherence and originality of your argument, as well
as your participation and response during the critique. As with all the
papers, your work should be your own and not merely a reproduction of our
discussions in class.

#### Second essay

**20%** The second essay depends on the genre you choose to write about. If
you are writing about poetry, choose a few poems and demonstrate a link
between them. If you are writing about prose, choose a passage (about a page
or less), and demonstrate its importance to the text as a whole. This essay
should also be 900–1200 words long. As with the previous essay, it should be
emailed by 23:59 on Tuesday, 25 Nov. Again, we will critique each other’s work
in class on the 27th, and then revisions will be due the following Tuesday.

#### Presentation

**15%** At some point in the semester, you will present secondary material of
your choice regarding the text we are reading for that day. The secondary
material should be contemporaneous with the original text, so book reviews in
magazines and the like are the best fit. The presentation should be up to five
minutes long. For guidelines on giving a good presentation, see [my webpage on
presentation tips](http://moacir.com/courses/presentation-tips/).

#### Final essay

**25%** The final essay is a critical work on one of the texts we have read.
It should build on the reading techniques from the first two essays, arguing a
larger point. You cannot write about a text you have already written about. A short
précis of the essay (up to 600 words) is due by 23:59 on 9 Dec. It should
model the essay in miniature—a prose outline, illustrating the essay’s structure,
context, and argument. We will discuss the précis in class. The final version
of the essay should be 1700–2000 words long. I am looking for the same things
as above, but also expect a richer critical vocabulary as you investigate your
topic of choice.
