## Course description

New York has played a crucial role in the history of media, and media have
placed a crucial role in the history of New York. New York has been
represented by media since Henry Hudson wrote his reports to the Dutch. Media
institutions have contributed centrally to its economy and social fabric,
while media geographies have shaped the experiences of city living. This
course explores media representations, institutions, and geographies across
time and is organized around the collaborative production of an online
guidebook to the media history of the East Village.

Concretely, we will be looking at media as networks with archæologies,
sacrificing coverage for the opportunities to get dirty and trace
spatiohistories from multiple vantage points. Our media history of New York,
then, is an archæology of Downtown (south of 14th Street). We will first look
to both the Astor Place Riot of 1849 and the Village Vanguard of the 1950s and
1960s before switching gears for the second half of the course to study the
mediascape of the East Village and environs from the 1960s to today. The
course culminates with producing a web-based exploration of that mediascape,
“Downtown Archæologies,” through artifacts found and studied by students
within the [Downtown Collection at the Fales
Library](https://guides.nyu.edu/downtown-collection/overview).
